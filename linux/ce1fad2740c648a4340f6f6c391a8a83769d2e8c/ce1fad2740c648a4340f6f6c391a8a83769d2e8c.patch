    Pull key handling fixes from David Howells:
     "Here are two patches, the first of which at least should go upstream
      immediately:
    
      (1) Prevent a user-triggerable crash in the keyrings destructor when a
          negatively instantiated keyring is garbage collected.  I have also
          seen this triggered for user type keys.
    
      (2) Prevent the user from using requesting that a keyring be created
          and instantiated through an upcall.  Doing so is probably safe
          since the keyring type ignores the arguments to its instantiation
          function - but we probably shouldn't let keyrings be created in
          this manner"
    
    * 'keys-fixes' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs:
      KEYS: Don't permit request_key() to construct a new keyring
      KEYS: Fix crash when attempt to garbage collect an uninstantiated keyring
