    ====================
    Raw socket cleanups
    
    Ori Nimron pointed out that there are a number of places in the kernel
    where you can create a raw socket, without having to have the
    CAP_NET_RAW permission.
    
    To resolve this, here's a short patch series to test these odd and old
    protocols for this permission before allowing the creation to succeed
    
    All patches are currently against the net tree.
