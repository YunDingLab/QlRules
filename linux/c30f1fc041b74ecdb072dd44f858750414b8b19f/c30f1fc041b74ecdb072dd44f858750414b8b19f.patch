    ====================
    ip: Use rb trees for IP frag queue.
    
    This patchset
     * changes IPv4 defrag behavior to match that of IPv6: overlapping
       fragments now cause the whole IP datagram to be discarded (suggested
       by David Miller): there are no legitimate use cases for overlapping
       fragments;
     * changes IPv4 defrag queue from a list to a rb tree (suggested
       by Eric Dumazet): this change removes a potential attach vector.
    
    Upcoming patches will contain similar changes for IPv6 frag queue,
    as well as a comprehensive IP defrag self-test (temporarily delayed).
